# Playwright API Automation

This is a ready-to-run Playwright API automation project for Astro Assignment

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Install Playwright browsers (not strictly required for API tests but recommended):

```
npx playwright install
```

3. Run tests:

```
npm test
```

Reports will be in `playwright-report/` (open with `npx playwright show-report`).

## Structure

- `tests/api/` — API test specs
- `playwright.config.ts` — Playwright config
